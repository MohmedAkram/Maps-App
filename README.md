Maps Application Documentation

Overview

This application is designed to represent cities as nodes on a graph and the roads between them as edges. It provides functionalities to:

Add cities and roads (with distances) to the graph.

Find the shortest path between two cities using efficient algorithms such as Dijkstra's or A*.

Display a visual representation of the graph and paths.

Features

1. Add Cities and Roads

Cities: Represented as nodes on the graph, each city has a unique identifier (name or number).

Roads: Represented as weighted edges connecting nodes. The weight corresponds to the distance between two cities.

Functionality:

Add a new city.

Add a road between two cities with a specific distance.

2. Find Shortest Path

Algorithms Supported:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source city to a destination city, suitable for graphs with non-negative weights.

A Algorithm (Optional):* Uses a heuristic to speed up the pathfinding process.

Inputs: Source and destination cities.

Outputs:

Shortest path distance.

Sequence of cities on the shortest path.

3. Visual Representation

Displays the graph with nodes and edges.

Highlights the shortest path between two cities.

Interactive user interface for adding/removing cities and roads.

Technical Implementation

Data Structures

Graph:

Implemented as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix.

Each node stores its connections and associated weights.

Priority Queue: Used in Dijkstra's algorithm for efficiently finding the next node with the smallest tentative distance.

Algorithms

Dijkstra's Algorithm:

Initialize distances to all nodes as infinity, except the source node (distance = 0).

Use a priority queue to explore nodes with the smallest distance.

Update distances to neighbors if a shorter path is found.

Repeat until all nodes are processed or the destination is reached.

Graph Operations

Add City: Adds a new node to the graph.

Add Road: Adds an edge with a weight between two nodes.

Remove City/Road: Deletes a node or edge and updates the graph structure.

User Interface (UI)

Main Screen:

Graph visualization panel.

Controls to add/remove cities and roads.

Input fields for source and destination cities.

Button to calculate the shortest path.

Path Display:

Highlights the shortest path on the graph.

Displays the total distance and the path sequence.

Example Workflow

Add cities (e.g., A, B, C, D).

Add roads with distances (e.g., A-B: 5, B-C: 3, A-D: 10, C-D: 4).

Find the shortest path from A to D.

The application calculates and displays the path (e.g., A → B → C → D) and the total distance (12).

Requirements

Software

Qt Creator or any suitable IDE.

C++11 or later (for efficient graph operations).

Qt Framework for UI development.

Libraries

Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures (e.g., priority_queue, vector).

Optional: Graph libraries for advanced features.

Hardware

Minimum: Standard PC for development and testing.

Recommended: System with a dedicated GPU for rendering complex graphs.

Future Enhancements

Add support for real-world maps and GPS integration.

Implement more pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Bellman-Ford for graphs with negative weights).

Enable user-defined heuristics for A*.

Support for dynamic edge weights (e.g., traffic conditions).

Troubleshooting

Incorrect Path Calculation: Ensure all nodes and edges are correctly added. Check for negative weights if using Dijkstra's algorithm.

UI Issues: Verify Qt configurations and recompile the project.

Performance Bottlenecks: Optimize graph data structures and use efficient algorithms.

Conclusion

This maps application serves as a foundational tool for understanding graph-based systems and pathfinding algorithms. It provides flexibility for educational purposes, prototype development, or integration into larger mapping projects.
